Chocolatey Dev Machine
======================

A [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/) package config for getting a new developer machine up and running.

Usage
-----

Assuming you've installed [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/), just run this from the repo folder:

    cinst .\chocolatey_packages.config

That's it!  Everything in the current package should install silently, but check it every so often to make sure it's still going.
